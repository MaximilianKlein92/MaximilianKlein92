## About Me
Neurobiologist by training — now applying **AI and digitalization** to sustainable material development.  
At **DITF Denkendorf**, I work on **environmentally friendly alternatives to textiles and leather**,  
developing digital tools and twins for **process understanding**, **simulation**, and **optimization**.

- **M.Sc. Computaional Neuroscience**  
- Developed a **self-learning robot** with a **plastic neural network** that adapts to changing environments with and without predators  
- Completed a **4-month Data Science training**: AI tools, data visualization, and dashboarding
